# ⛽ My Fuel Calculator ⛽
This native Android application, fully developed in Kotlin, calculates the amount of fuel (in liters) required for a user-defined trip and estimates the total refueling cost. The app allows users to input details about their journey, 
such as distance and fuel efficiency and then provides a breakdown of how much gasoline will be needed and the corresponding cost. The results are displayed on a dedicated screen, offering users a clear and intuitive overview of their fuel expenses for the trip.
